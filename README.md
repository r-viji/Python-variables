# Python-variables
- Variable is used to allocate the **memory location**.
- Its also known as **identifier**.
- Python we don't need to specify the type of variable because Python is a **type infer language** and smart enough to get variable type.
- python variable value assign with a **single equals sign (=).
    - **Example**
    - **n=100**
- If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
    - **Example**
    - **x = str("welcome")**
    - **y = int(3)**
    - **z = float(3)**
- You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
    - **Exapmle**
    - **x = 5**
    - **y = "John"**
    - **print(type(x))**
    - **print(type(y))**
- Variable names are case-sensitive.
    - **Example**
    - **a=10**
    - **A=15**
